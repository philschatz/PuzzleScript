TO DOs:

- [x] remove custom nearley
- [ ] move sound effects hacks into their respective Node/Browser repos (or find a way so puzzlescript core does not depend on it)
- [ ] move PWA to separate repos
- [ ] move playgame tests to something other than unit tests (so the unit tests will run faster)
- [ ] move the games and solutions into a separate package
- [ ] bring browser tests back
- [ ] bring code coverage back for all packages
- [ ] use ts-node to run scripts like `node ./lib/script/buildGameIcons.js`

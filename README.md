This is a program that you can run in your terminal to play [PuzzleScript](https://puzzlescript.net) games.

Also, it is **accessible**, meaning that [blind or visually impaired people can play these games](#video-games-that-blind-people-can-play) too!


## Install

1. Run `npm install -g puzzlescript-cli`
1. Run `puzzlescript` to start playing


# Screencaps

Here are some screencaps of games being played.

# Video games that blind people can play?

PuzzleScript lends itself nicely to be playable by people with low or no vision:

1. each level is small (~10x10)
1. each sprite has a human-readable name (since the whole game is in 1 text file and the logic refers to the sprites)
1. a blind person has 2 sets of directions (one to move the player and one to move the “eye” which reads off which sprite is in that spot)
1. the games do not require quick reflexes and have Undo built-in so it is easy to think and try different options
1. we can just print to the terminal whenever something needs to be read (presumably the terminal is read aloud to the person)


### Screencap

This screencap is a visual demonstration of exploring and then playing a level.

This screencap is the **non-visual** version of the same steps as shown above. This is what vision-impaired people will read when they move the Inspector cursor around and then move the player to play the game.

# About

The goal of this project is to do 3 things:

1. make PuzzleScript easier to embed (like in 404 pages, easter eggs, etc). See [docs](https://philschatz.com/puzzlescript-cli/docs/classes/_engine_.gameengine.html)
1. allow **blind people to play video games** (by passing the `--no-ui` argument)
1. use the terminal as a GUI for playing games


# Dev Notes

This is a remake of PuzzleScript that has the following features:

- There is [documentation](https://philschatz.com/puzzlescript-cli/docs/) for using the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puzzlescript-cli)
- There is a [Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) file that parses the game file (uses [ohm](https://github.com/harc/ohm))
- The interpreter is a separate component
- The rendering code is abstracted out so folks can add a different renderer (the example uses ASCII in the Terminal to show the game)
  - This allows for fun things like adding an accessible-friendly interface to play the games
  - Inspired by https://askubuntu.com/questions/699159/ascii-animations-that-are-viewed-in-the-command-line#699161
- The input code is abstracted out so gamepads, buttons, etc can easily be provided
  - This also allows computers to play the games!

## Commands

- `npm run docs` generates docs in the `./docs/` directory
- `npm run play` runs a game in the [./gists/](./gists/) directory without debugging info (10x faster) (uses `NODE_ENV=production`)
- `npm run play-dev` runs a game in the [./gists/](./gists/) directory with sprite info (useful for debugging)
- `npm run play-debug` runs a game in the [./gists/](./gists/) directory with a Chrome Debugger open so you can set breakpoints
- `npm start` runs all of the games in the [./gists/](./gists/) directory with a few sample moves (up/down/left/right/action)
- `npm test` runs all of the unit tests (including solutions in the [./gist-solutions/](./gist-solutions/) directory)
- `npm run watch` Run the tests and when you update the source, it re-runs the tests
- `npm run test-debug` Run the tests but opens a debugger (remember to add a `debugger` line into the JavaScript)
- `npm test; open coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to see test coverage
- `npm run coverage` generates a coverage report which includes the JS code as well as any games that you ran in dev mode (using `npm run dev`)

## Objects

- **Level** contains a table of Cells which contain a set of Sprites that should be rendered
- **Rule** contains the conditions and actions to be executed.
  - It also contains methods for checking if the Rule matches a Cell and methods for how to change the Cell
- **Cell** contains a set of Sprites and is used to represent the current state of the Game


# TODO

Want to help? Here is a roadmap of things that need to be implemented:

- [ ] support tabbing through the sprites to say where they are and how many of them are in the puzzle
- [ ] output which sprites changed when the player moves or presses undo
- [ ] improve the sound effects (needs an implementation of [BiquadFilter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode) in NodeJS)
- [ ] support the `RIGID` keyword
- [ ] output a simple `BEL` (ASCII character 7) when the `speaker` package is not installed
- [ ] output sound effects when any of the following occur:
    - a sprite is `CREATE`, `DESTROY`, `CANTMOVE`
    - a sprite is moved
    - `RESTART`, `UNDO`, `TITLESCREEN`, `STARTGAME`, `STARTLEVEL`, `ENDLEVEL`, `ENDGAME`, `SHOWMESSAGE`, `CLOSEMESSAGE`
